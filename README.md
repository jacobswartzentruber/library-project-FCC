# [Personal Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library)

This is a Personal Library project for Free Code Camp Quality Assurance Course.

The base code is from the Personal Library Boilerplate linked above. I added the routing and logic necessary to complete the user stories for the challenge.

Since this project is contained within the Quality Assurance Course, I wrote functional tests using Mocha and Chai to help validate all input and output are within desired expectations.
